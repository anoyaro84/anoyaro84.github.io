<p style="text-align:justify">
I am an assistant professor in oncogenomics at the Amsterdam Universtiy Medical Center (<a href="https://www.amsterdamumc.nl/">Amsterdam UMC</a>). I am interested in how informatics technologies (especially machine learning) can make our life better, especially in the treatment of cancer patients. To this end, I exposed myself to both biology and computer science during my PhD training and postdoc period.

<p style="text-align:justify">
Together with other PIs in the group, I am leading the Tumor Genome Analysis Core (<a href="https://www.tgac.nl">TGAC</a>) of <a href="https://www.vumc.nl/zorg/expertisecentra-en-specialismen/cancer-center-amsterdam.htm">Cancer Center Amsterdam</a>.
