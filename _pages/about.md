<p style="text-align:justify">
I am an assistant professor in oncogenomics at the Amsterdam Universtiy Medical Center (<a href="https://www.amsterdamumc.nl/">Amsterdam UMC</a>). I am interested in how informatics technologies (especially machine learning) can make our life better, especially in the treatment of cancer patients. To this end, I exposed myself to both biology and computer science during my PhD training and postdoc period.
