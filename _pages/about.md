I am an assistant professor in oncogenomics. I am interested in how informatics technologies (especially machine learning) can make our life better, especially in the treatment of cancer patients. To this end, I exposed myself to both biology and computer science during my training.

<p style="text-align:justify">
During Ph.D. training, I had participated in the systems biology lab and machine learning group, working on identifying better ways to model biological networks. After Ph.D., I continued my academic career in cancer genomics as a postdoctoral fellow at the NKI, where I worked as a part of the group of prof. dr. Wilbert Zwart, a molecular biologist, and the group of prof. dr. Lodewyk Wessels, a computational scientist.

As of 1st of October 2018, I started as an assistant professor in oncogenomics, at Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc. At the current position, I am delighted with having many interactions with clinicians, pathologists, and oncologists who see patients, getting more stimulation towards translational research.
