Together with Perry Moerland, Jos Poell and Betty Tijms, we will soon start Cell2Sample project, one of the three projects supported in Biocomputing focus group of ADORE.

We will be hosting two PhD students, one focusing on multi-omics data integration (hosted by the TGAC) and the other on spatial omics data analysis (hosted by Bioinformatics lab; Perry Moerland).
